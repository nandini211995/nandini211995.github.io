I am an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA. My research is centered around foundations of probabilistic machine learning for unsupervised representation learning and sequential decision making, and is grounded in applications at the intersection of physical sciences and climate change.

Before joining UCLA, I was a research scientist in the Core ML team at FAIR in Meta. Previously, I completed my postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley (2021; advisor: Pieter Abbeel), PhD at Stanford University (2020; advisor: Stefano Ermon) and bachelors at IIT Delhi (2015; co-advisors: Mausam, Parag Singla), all in computer science. During my PhD, I spent wonderful summers interning at Google Brain, Microsoft Research, and OpenAI.
